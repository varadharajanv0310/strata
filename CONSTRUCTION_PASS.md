# strata — construction pass (architecture · code · pipeline)

**Date:** 2026-06-25 · **Branch:** `build-pass` (local only — not pushed) · **Author:** V Varadharajan

This pass finishes pending *construction* — architecture, code, pipeline, wiring, loaders,
connectors, and UI surfaces for already-built analytics — so that the only stages left are
**runs, validation, and population**. It explicitly does **not** run GPU/ingestion jobs or
populate/publish the live site; every new piece is coded + tested-importable and left ready
for the later run stage. Suite stays green (23 passed) throughout; the frontend builds clean.

It opened with a rigorous dataset-ideation **council** (5 proposers + a chair), per the
mandate to think openly about datasets to add before building.

---

## Part A — Dataset council: candidates considered, with include/exclude calls

Guardrails (every call grounded in them): **(G1)** joins on country/skill/role/time AND adds
a genuinely new signal; **(G2)** legitimately + durably obtainable (no ToS-violating scraping);
**(G3)** roles-only — no company/employer sources. Bias toward inclusion; effort is never a
reason to cut. 29 candidates surfaced → **27 INCLUDE, ~11 EXCLUDE**.

### INCLUDE (the new-signal set)

| Source | New signal | Call & reason |
|---|---|---|
| **ILOSTAT** earnings by ISCO-08 | cross-country wage **spine** (all 7 on one axis) | INCLUDE — backbone of honest cross-country comparison; only harmonized source. **BUILT this pass.** |
| **US BLS Employment Projections** | forward 10-yr occupation growth | INCLUDE — the demand-outlook axis is empty; authoritative. |
| **Canada Job Bank Outlooks + COPS** | star outlook + 10-yr projection | INCLUDE — both horizons in one country. |
| **Jobs & Skills Australia** projections + shortage list | growth + **shortage/surplus flag** | INCLUDE — supply signal held nowhere else. |
| **O\*NET Related Occupations** | role→role **adjacency** (trajectory) | INCLUDE — highest-value trajectory primitive, zero new fetch. **BUILT this pass.** |
| **O\*NET skill-importance vectors** | per-role core-vs-peripheral skill weight | INCLUDE — authoritative weighting we lacked. **BUILT this pass.** |
| **O\*NET Career Changers Matrix** | empirical mobility edges | INCLUDE — independent 2nd trajectory signal (separate download; not yet fetched). |
| **ESCO** occupation→skill + essential/optional | European multilingual skill map | INCLUDE — turns the `load_crosswalk_file` stub real. **BUILT this pass (loader).** |
| **ESCO** broader/narrower tree | vertical role hierarchy | INCLUDE — near-free once ESCO is wired. |
| **Stack Exchange data dump** | tag volume decay/emergence + adjacency | INCLUDE — cleanest "rising or dying" series; the durability keystone. |
| **PyPI (BigQuery)** | adoption volume, **has country_code** | INCLUDE — rare adoption signal with a country axis. |
| **npm / crates / NuGet / RubyGems** | multi-ecosystem adoption | INCLUDE — one batched connector kills language bias. |
| **arXiv** submission velocity | earliest leading emergence indicator | INCLUDE — 12-24mo lead on jobs. |
| **Hugging Face Hub** velocity | decomposes the AI/ML blob | INCLUDE — best decomposition of the fastest cluster. |
| **Wikipedia pageviews** | attention **normalizer** (hype vs adoption) | INCLUDE — serves the honesty mission. |
| **EURES** (ESCO-tagged EU vacancies) | gov vacancy volume + skills (DE) | INCLUDE — strongest new DE demand feed. |
| **Bundesagentur Entgeltatlas** | official DE wage by KldB × region | INCLUDE — realized DE wage spine. |
| **Bundesagentur Jobsuche** | live DE vacancy volume | INCLUDE (version-pin; unofficial key flagged). |
| **MyCareersFuture** (SG gov board) | posted salary + skills | INCLUDE — fills thin SG live data. |
| **USAJobs** | US public-sector pay band | INCLUDE — a stratum held nowhere. |
| **HN "Who is Hiring"** | 15-yr IC demand + remote-share | INCLUDE — deep history; trend/share signal. |
| **RemoteOK** | remote postings with salary | INCLUDE — strengthens the remote stratum. |
| **Cedefop Skills-OVATE** | EU skill-demand, pre-de-companied | INCLUDE — pre-aggregated to our grain. |
| **SO survey tenure-cohort** (derived) | multi-country within-role trajectory | INCLUDE — fills the H-1B ladder's US-only blind spot. |
| **Wikidata occupation subgraph** | occupation→occupation/skill edges | INCLUDE **only** with every employer/org property stripped at ingest. |
| **CFP / conference topics** | leading skill momentum | INCLUDE (experimental, low priority, noisy). |

### EXCLUDE (with the failing guardrail)

| Source | Why excluded |
|---|---|
| LinkedIn / Indeed / Glassdoor / Levels.fyi | **G2 + G3** — scraping ToS + company-tier salary |
| H1BGrader / myvisajobs employer cuts | **G3** — reintroduces employer as the unit |
| Hiring.cafe / aggregator scrapes | **G2** — fragile + ToS-murky |
| India PLFS / NCS | **G1 + G2** — too coarse (NIC industry); no clean bulk dump |
| UK Working Futures projections | **G2** — not refreshed since 2014 (stale) |
| We Work Remotely | low-signal (category RSS, no salary) — redundant with RemoteOK |
| Docker Hub / Homebrew pulls | **G1** — CI-pull noise, muddy package→skill map |
| GitHub language-trend connector | redundant — GH Archive already ingested |
| OECD.Stat earnings | folded into ILOSTAT (India absent there) |
| VS Code / JetBrains installs | unofficial endpoints — hold as corroboration only |
| UK Find-a-Job (DWP) | deferred pending a durable (non-scrape) feed check |

## Part B — What was built this pass (12 granular commits)

**Warehouse schema** (`schema.py`) — 5 new tables for the new axes: `fact_salary_official`
(the 3rd salary lens), `fact_role_outlook` (demand-outlook), `fact_skill_adoption`
(emergence/durability), `bridge_role_adjacency` (trajectory), `bridge_role_skill_importance`.
*Ready for:* the connectors/derivations that land into them.

**O\*NET trajectory** (`warehouse/onet_trajectory.py`, new) — parses the **already-cached**
O\*NET zip (no fetch) into role→role adjacency (87 edges) + per-role skill importance (1,316
rows, concrete tools mapped to our vocab + generic O\*NET skills). *Verified on cache.*

**Fusion** (`warehouse/build.py`) — `build_warehouse_from_staging` now fuses: (1) the **3rd
salary lens** from the already-ingested baselines (BLS/ONS/Eurostat/MOM) + ILOSTAT-when-landed,
(2) O\*NET adjacency + skill-importance bridges, (3) **real facts for derived roles** — demand
from their own posting volume + a skill bag from member titles, salary left absent so the UI
honestly says "not enough data" (fixes the name-without-data half-build). *Verified in-memory
+ end-to-end via the publish test (73 official, 87 adjacency, 1,304 importance).*

**Clustering reconciliation** (`ml/role_derivation.py`) — the two divergent paths are now one:
role discovery clusters the **composite fingerprint** (title⊕skills⊕dept⊕salary-band) via
`fingerprint.composite_document`, identical to the scale path. No more title-only clustering.

**Taxonomy** (`warehouse/taxonomy.py`) — `load_esco` (real ESCO occupations loader → aliases +
crosswalk via ISCO, was a stub) and `mine_emergent_roles` (real emergent-role miner → promotes
cross-country labels with no canonical match to 'emerging' birth nodes, was a TODO). Both wired
into `build_taxonomy`, graceful when their inputs are absent.

**Connector** (`ingest/ilostat.py`, new) — real credential-graceful ILOSTAT connector (cross-
country wage spine, council #1), wired into the official lens + registered as a pipeline stage.

**Marts** (`marts/models.py`, `materialize.py`) — `MartRoleCountry` gains realized + official
medians (each nullable → honest "not enough data"); new `mart_role_adjacency` +
`mart_role_skill_importance`; `materialize_from_warehouse` now also builds the alias +
provenance marts (one comprehensive pass).

**API** (`app/services.py`) — role payloads carry `salaryLenses {advertised, realized,
official}`, `trajectory`, and `importance`.

**UI** (`src/app/roles.jsx`, `main.jsx`) — role dashboard renders the **three salary lenses**,
a roles-only **"Where this role leads"** trajectory card (clickable adjacent roles), an
**importance-weighted skills** panel, and a header **"Data ↗"** link to the DuckDB-WASM console.
*Vite build clean; app renders with no console errors; panels light up once data is materialized.*

**CLI / pipeline** (`cli.py`, `collect_all.py`) — `strata publish` command; `onet_trajectory`
and `ilostat` registered as pipeline stages. **Housekeeping:** prove_scaling divide-by-zero
fix; base.py join-keys aligned to roles-only.

---

## Part C — Key design decisions

- **Three salary lenses, never blended.** Advertised (Adzuna), realized (SO+H-1B), official
  (baselines+ILOSTAT) live in separate facts and render side-by-side, each with its source. A
  lens with no data shows "not enough data" rather than borrowing another — the honesty rule.
- **One clustering representation.** Reconciled to the composite fingerprint so role discovery
  and the scale path cannot diverge (the previously-flagged inconsistency).
- **Derived roles must carry real signal.** A promoted cluster gets demand + skills from its own
  postings; salary stays honestly absent. No more empty dashboards behind a derived name.
- **Roles-only, enforced.** Adjacency/trajectory edges are occupation→occupation only; Wikidata
  is INCLUDE *only* with employer/org properties stripped; the connector inclusion rule dropped
  "employer" from its join keys.
- **Cached-data work is verified; network connectors are coded-not-run.** O\*NET/ESCO/derived-role
  logic was verified against cached files; ILOSTAT (and the rest) are structurally real but
  unverified until the run stage — flagged honestly below.

---

## Part D — Intentionally left for the run / validate / populate stages

- **GPU/ingestion runs** — `collect_all` stages (incl. new `ilostat`, `onet_trajectory`) are
  wired but not executed.
- **The warehouse fuse** — `build_warehouse_from_staging` is built + tested but not run against
  the persistent warehouse (running it is the fuse stage).
- **Marts materialize + publish** — `materialize_from_warehouse` (now comprehensive) and
  `strata publish` are wired but not run; running them is the populate/cutover step.
- Consequently the new UI panels render empty on the *current* served DB and populate only after
  fuse → materialize.

## Part E — Brutally honest: what still needs BUILDING after this pass

This pass did **not** finish all construction. The honest gaps:

1. **The bulk of the council's connectors are not coded.** A parallel agent fleet was launched
   to build 16 connectors at once; **all 16 agents failed on the account's session limit**
   (resets 3pm Asia/Calcutta), so only **O\*NET (cached) and ILOSTAT (hand-built solo)** exist.
   Still to build (specced in Part A, ready to write): **gov_projections** (BLS-EP/Canada-COPS/
   JSA → `fact_role_outlook`), **Stack Exchange**, **package_registries**, **arXiv**,
   **Hugging Face**, **Wikipedia pageviews** (→ `fact_skill_adoption`), **EURES**,
   **Bundesagentur** (Entgeltatlas + Jobsuche), **MyCareersFuture**, **USAJobs**, **Cedefop**,
   **HN Who-is-Hiring**, **RemoteOK**, **Wikidata occupations**. The schema destinations
   (`fact_role_outlook`, `fact_skill_adoption`) exist and are empty, awaiting these.
2. **Fusion + marts + UI for outlook and skill-adoption.** Tables exist; the fuse readers,
   marts, API fields, and UI panels for the demand-outlook and skill-durability axes are not yet
   built (they were to follow their connectors).
3. **Lightcast Open Skills/Titles loader** — INCLUDE'd; ESCO was built, Lightcast was not.
4. **O\*NET Career Changers Matrix + SO tenure-cohort** — INCLUDE'd trajectory signals; not built.
5. **Role-level H-1B promotion ladder → UI** — `analytics/promotion_ladder.py` exists but the
   dashboard still shows the curated ladder; not yet served via a mart.
6. **Hedonic skill premiums → UI** — `ml/hedonic.py` exists but is backend-only; no mart/API/UI.
7. **Provenance lineage in the badge popover** — the API returns lineage; the popover does not
   yet render the snapshot/transform/row-count tuple.
8. **ILOSTAT and every other network connector are unverified against live endpoints** — coded
   defensively but correctness can only be confirmed by a run.

**Net:** the cached-data analytics (trajectory, three-lens-from-baselines, derived-role facts),
the clustering reconciliation, the taxonomy loaders/miner, and the serving chain (schema → fuse
→ marts → API → UI) are built and tested. The **new-source connector fleet is the major
remaining construction**, blocked mid-pass by an external account limit rather than by design —
it should be built (re-run the fleet, or hand-build) once capacity returns, before the run stage.
